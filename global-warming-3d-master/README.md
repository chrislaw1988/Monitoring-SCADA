## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purpose.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the project :

- [Java 8 SE](https://www.java.com/fr/download/)

If you use a later JDK, be careful because JavaFX is decoupled from the JDK since the JDK 11.
You have to download it separately [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

- [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) for testing purpose.


### Installing

Here are some instructions on how to get the development env running.

First, clone this repository with the following command :

`git clone https://github.com/adepreis/global-warming-3d`

Then create the Java project from `/src` folder using your favorite IDE.

Don't forget to include the [ObjModelImporterJFX library](http://www.interactivemesh.org/models/jfx3dimporter.html), the .jar file is located in `/libs`.


### Testing

Don't forget to include JUnit 4 (or later) library to the project.

The existing unit tests are classified by package in `/test`.
